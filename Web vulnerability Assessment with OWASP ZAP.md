  ### 15 Vulnerabilities Found
	 
**1.Name of Vulnerability:** Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
- **The solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

**2.Name of vulnerability:** Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server. The CORS misconfiguration on the web server permits cross-domain read requests from arbitrary third party domains, using unauthenticated APIs on this domain. Web browser implementations do not permit arbitrary third parties to read the response from authenticated APIs, however. This reduces the risk somewhat. This misconfiguration could be used by an attacker to access data that is available in an unauthenticated manner, but which uses some other form of security, such as IP address white-listing.
- **The solution:** Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance). Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.

**3.Name of vulnerability:** Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com 
- **What it does:** The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.
- **The solution:** Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app. If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

**4.Name of the Vulnerability:** Session ID in URL Rewrite
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** URL rewrite is used to track user session ID. The session ID may be disclosed via cross-site referer header. In addition, the session ID might be stored in browser history or server logs.
- **The solution:** For secure content, put session ID in a cookie. To be even more secure consider using a combination of cookie and URL rewrite.

**6.Name of vulnerability:** Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** The page includes one or more script files from a third-party domain.
- **The solution:** Ensure JavaScript source files are loaded from only trusted sources, and the sources can't be controlled by end users of the application.

**7.Name of vulnerability:** Private IP Disclosure
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** A private IP (such as 10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x) or an Amazon EC2 private hostname (for example, ip-10-0-56-78) has been found in the HTTP response body. This information might be helpful for further attacks targeting internal systems.
- **The solution:** Remove the private IP address from the HTTP response body. For comments, use JSP/ASP/PHP comment instead of HTML/JavaScript comment which can be seen by client browsers.

**8.Name of vulnerability:** Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:* HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL). HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.
- **The solution:** Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to enforceStrict-Transport-Security.

**9.Name of vulnerability:** Timestamp Disclosure – Unix
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** A timestamp was disclosed by the application/web server. - Unix
- **The solution:** Manually confirm that the timestamp data is not sensitive, and that the data cannot be aggregated to disclose exploitable patterns.

**10.Name of vulnerability:** X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What I does:** The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
- **The solution:** Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages. If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

**11.Name of vulnerability:** Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** The response appears to contain suspicious comments which may help an attacker. Note: Matches made within script blocks or files are against the entire content not only comments.
- **The solution:** Remove all comments that return information that may help an attacker and fix any underlying problems they refer to.

**12.Name of vulnerability:** Modern Web Application
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** The application appears to be a modern web application. If you need to explore it automatically then the Ajax Spider may well be more effective than the standard one.
- **The solution:** This is an informational alert and so no changes are required.

**13.Name of vulnerability:** Re-examine Cache-control Directive
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** The cache-control header has not been set properly or is missing, allowing the browser and proxies to cache content. For static assets like css, js, or image files this might be intended, however, the resources should be reviewed to ensure that no sensitive content will be cached.
- **The solution:** For secure content, ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate". If an asset should be cached consider setting the directives "public, max-age, immutable".

**14.Name of vulnerability:** Retrieved from Cache
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** Another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.
- **The solution:** Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user.

15.Name of vulnerability: Session Management Response Identified
- **Where it is found:** https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
- **What it does:** The given response has been identified as containing a session management token. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of header tokens that can be used in the Header Based Session Management Method. If the request is in a context which has a Session Management Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the session management to use the tokens identified.
- **The solution:** This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.
